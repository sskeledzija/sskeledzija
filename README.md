Hi! I am Sasa Skeledzija, currently working as a Software Engineer. 
I have great experience in software development and design. Always enthusiastic about the new technologies, always reading and learning about the "cool new stuff". 
Mostly used technology is JAVA/Kotlin with corresponding tools, frameworks and libraries. Some of the used technologies: Spring/Spring Boot, Hibernate, JPA, JMS, Restful, Databases, Azure Infrastructure etc. 
I do also Frontend Development, for example with React JS, Angular and lately VueJS. 
In last few years I have been also working with messaging/streaming systems like Apache Kafka. In more than 20 years working in software development area I have gained great experience in end-to-end software life cycle development and also as a project development lead, working on various and challenging projects for mostly demanding customers.

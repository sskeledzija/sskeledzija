Hi! I am Sasa Skeledzija, currently working as a Consultant and Senior Software Developer. 
I have great experience in software design and development. Always enthusiastic about the new technologies, always reading and learning about the "cool new stuff". 
Mostly used technology is JAVA with corresponding tools, frameworks and libraries (Spring, Spring Boot, Hibernate, JPA, JMS, Restful, Servlets, and similar). 
I have also Frontend Development experience, for example with React JS, Angular and JSF. 
In last few years I have been also working with messaging/streaming systems like Apache Kafka. In more than 15 years working in software development area I have gained great experience in end-to-end software life cycle development and also as a project development lead, working on various and challenging projects for mostly demanding customers.

On this profile you can also find latest project (unfortunatelly still under construction) - a kind of Advanced Appointement tool, 
written in Java, Kotlin, React and Express. Running on Spring Boot with MongoDB as Database. Check it out :)

Demo app example, everything runs on AWS, including MongoDB. This is just a initial, pre-flight version, and is far from finished, point of this deployment was just to have PoC which does something.
